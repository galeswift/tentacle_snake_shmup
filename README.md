# tentacle_snake_shmup

An old gamejam game made for a shoot-em-up forum contest.  Basically it's snake with more freedom of movement, powerups and more enemies.  The more pellets of the same color you pick up in a row, the stronger your next action will be (it enhances the # of projectiles, duration of shields, etc).   Firing your weapon consumes your tail segments.
